# <u>Loan Status Prediction System:-</u>
## *In this project, our objective is to conduct an in-depth exploration and analysis of this dataset. We use three distinct classification algorithms—K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayes, and Logistic Regrssion —to forecast the loan status. Our study includes a comparative examination of the performance of these algorithms based on various evaluation metrics.*
